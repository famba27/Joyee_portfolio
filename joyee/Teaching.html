    <h1>Teaching</h1>
    <p>KNH school of nursing has been in operation for the last 36 years. It trains Nurses at higher diploma level. <br>
        <br>
        These are nurses who have already had a training in nursing at either a diploma or bachelor’s level and who wish to specialize in either Critical care, Nephrology, Neonatal, Oncology, Perioperative or trauma and Emergency Nursing programs. <br>
        All these courses are regulated by the Nursing Council of Kenya (NCK). 

        I was assigned lessons in Fundamentals of Nursing practice, in all the six courses, <br>
        and facilitated quite a number of specific topics in Nephrology nursing; being my area of specialty. <br>
        Some topics were taught virtually while some were taught physically. <br>
        I was also involved in setting, moderating, administering, marking and dispatching examination results.
        
        I was able to facilitate learning using various teaching,<br>
         and instructional strategies that included modified interactive lectures, small group discussions, individual student mentoring sessions. <br>
         Some of the instructional media included use laptop and LCD projectors, white board , marker pens, flip charts, and speakers.<br>
         These helped make the lessons quite interactive and interesting.</p>
